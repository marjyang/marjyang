## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marjorie!

Iâ€™m an aspiring product manager with a background in strategy, design, and development. Iâ€™m currently pursuing an MS in Technology Innovation @ UW, where Iâ€™m building on my technical and business foundations while exploring how to bring ideas to life through thoughtful products.

This GitHub includes a mix of projectsâ€”from web apps and data visualizations to more recent hardware/software builds from my program. I use this space to experiment, learn, and push my technical range as a PM.
