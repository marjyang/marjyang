ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marjorie!

Iâ€™m an aspiring product manager with a background spanning strategy, development, and design. Iâ€™m currently pursuing an MS in Technology Innovation at the University of Washington, where I focus on building connected hardware/software products.

Here youâ€™ll find a mix of past and ongoing projectsâ€”from creative side projects to more recent technical builds from my program. Iâ€™m always exploring, prototyping, and learning.
