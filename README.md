## 👋 Hi, I’m Marjorie!

I’m an aspiring product manager with a background in strategy, design, and development. I’m currently pursuing a master’s in Technology Innovation at the University of Washington, where I’m building on my technical foundations while exploring how to bring ideas to life through thoughtful products.

This GitHub includes a mix of projects—from web apps and data visualizations to more recent hardware/software builds from my program. I use this space to experiment, learn, and push my technical range as a PM.
